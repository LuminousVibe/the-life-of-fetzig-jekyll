    Type bundle exec jekyll serve --watch at the command line* to start running your website locally.
	Visit http://localhost:4000/the-life-of-fetzig in chrome to see a local preview.
	*Open start menu, type CMD, right click -> "Run as Administrator"

    Hit control-c at the command line to stop running the website locally.

    While the site is running, after making changes to website files:
	save the files and refresh the webpage to see the changes—except for the _config.yml file,
	for which you must stop running the website and restart running the website to see changes.

    Typing or pasting in bundle exec jekyll serve --watch a lot? Instead, you can type the ↑
	(up arrow) at the command line to scroll through recently typed commands; just press enter after the
	command you want to use appears.
